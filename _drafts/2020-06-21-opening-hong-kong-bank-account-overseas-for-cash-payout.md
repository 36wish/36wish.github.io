title: Opening Hong Kong bank account overseas for Cash Payout
---
Hong Kong government launched a Cash Payout scheme in June 2020. Everyone over 18 with a HK Permanent ID card is eligible to collect HK$10000. If you are not in Hong Kong, this post will show you how to open a HK account to collect the money and transfer it to your overseas account.

There is an option to collect a cheque and cash it in person in HK before December 2021. However, collecting it online means you don't need to go back in person. You will need a bank account with one of the [21 participating banks](https://www.cashpayout.gov.hk/eng/faqs.html#c21). 

Out of the 21, only 1 will allow you to open an account overseas without onerous requirements (like being a HK tax resident or deposit HK$1m in the account): it is [Bank of Communications](https://www.hk.bankcomm.com/).

## What you need
- An Apple iOS 10.0+ or Android 6.0+ device
- Your Hong Kong Permanent Smart Identity Card, old version (the version with the [chip on the font](https://www.cashpayout.gov.hk/images/id_f.jpg))
