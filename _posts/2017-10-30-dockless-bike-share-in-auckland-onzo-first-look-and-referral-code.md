Dockless bike shares have been a thing overseas for a while now, and it's so exciting to see it in Auckland! I took one out for a spin on the pink Lightpath today.

The bikes are from a Chinese company called Onzo. As usual, you register by downloading their app [[Android](Android)] [[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/onzo/id1291209476?mt=8)] and entering your credit card details. It charges a $10 deposit (refundable) and they give you $10 credit for signing up. If you enter my referral code **OFUTPK** you get another $1 bonus.

You scan the QR code on the bike using the app to unlock it, and once you've finished with it, just put it in a safe location and lock the bike. Easy. The price currently is $0.25/15 minutes.

The bikes are pretty basic but functional. There's no gears though which does make it harder pedalling it up Auckland's hills. Otherwise it's a pretty good ride.

One front and one back brake, and a twisty bell.

You can check out the locations of the bikes on the app, looks like they got quite a few.

The app's not well polished though. There's still some text untranslated in Chinese, it's crash prone and some buttons will get pushed off screen if your phone's font size is too big. Hopefully they can get this fixed soon.
