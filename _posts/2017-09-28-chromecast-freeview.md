You want to watch live Freeview NZ TV, but you don't have a decoder and all you have is a Chromecast? No problem, just follow these steps to get started.

1. Download [Server Cast](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instantbits.cast.dcast&hl=en)
2. Add the following server to the app: `http://www.apsattv.com/kiwitv.m3u`
3. Start casting!

TVNZ and Three have their apps that can also cast live TV, but this way you get to !
