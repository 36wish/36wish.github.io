Kwikli is a electric moped rental service in New Zealand! You sign up with the app, then use it to unlock mopeds parked around the city. You pay by the minute then park it anywhere in zone after you've done.

Sign up with my [referral code](https://kwikli.frontend.fleetbird.eu/language/en/register?promotionCode=P9vqdCSq) for bonus: **P9vqdCSq**.
