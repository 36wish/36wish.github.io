title: Opening Hong Kong bank account overseas for Cash Payout
---
Hong Kong government launched a Cash Payout scheme in June 2020. Everyone over 18 with a HK Permanent ID card is eligible to collect HK$10000. If you are not in Hong Kong, this post will show you how to open a HK account to collect the money and transfer it to your local account.

There is an option to collect a cheque and cash it in person in HK before December 2021. However, collecting it online means you don't need to go back in person. You will need a bank account with one of the [21 participating banks](https://www.cashpayout.gov.hk/eng/faqs.html#c21). 

Out of the 21, only 1 will allow you to open an account overseas without onerious requirements (like being a HK tax resident or deposit HK$1m in the account): it is [Bank of Communications](https://www.hk.bankcomm.com/).

## What you need
- An iOS 10.0+ or Android 6.0+ device
- Your Hong Kong Permanent Smart Identity Card, old version (the version with the [chip on the font](https://www.cashpayout.gov.hk/images/id_f.jpg)) 

## Overview
1. Open an account
2. Activate your account
3. Raise transfer limit
4. Register for cash payout
5. Transfer money out
